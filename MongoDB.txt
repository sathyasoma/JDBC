MangoDB  or MongoDB ????????

MongoDB 

Humongous
    extreamly large: huge a humangous  building humongos amounts of money
	

MongoDB is the most populer and trending database.

https://www.mongodb.com/



Where we can use MongoDB database:
---------------

we can use everywhere 

for desktop applications, for mobile applications

for web applications, this datatbase is more populer.


Full Stack develeper:

stack:---> the technologies which we can be used to develop web applications are called stack.

The most populer stacks:

  1. MEAN Stack:
  2. MERN Stack:
  
  1. MEAN :
       M==>MongoDB
	   E==>Express
	   A=>Angular
	   N==>Nodejs
	   
2. MERN

       M==>MongoDB
	   E==>Express
	   R=>React
	   N==>Nodejs

   
React or Angular is front end framework
Express Js is the backend server side framework
Node js is responsible to provide server side runtime environment
Mongodb==Database

 
 By using MEAN and MERN Stacks we can build javascript based web applications.
 
 Node js is based on javascript 
 React or ngular js is based on java Script 
 Express is based on the javascript 
 MongoDB is also based java script
 
 
 MongoDB internally uses Mozilla's Spider Monkey javascript Engine.
 
  Q. what is the type of MongoDB Database.
      it is Document Database/Nosql databse
	  
 Relational Database vs Document Database:
 =======================================
  
 There are two most common types of databases.
 
 1. Relational Dtabase/sql dtabase
 2. Document Database/Nosql dtabase
 
  Relational Dtabase/sql dtabase:
  ============================
	The data will be stored in tables and these tables has fixed schema 
 Employee(eno, ename, esal)
    The data stored in tables has relationships like 
        one to one 
        one to many
        many to one 
   etc


To retrive data from relational databse, we have to write join queries which .collects data from different tables.
   eg: oracle,mysql
   
   
2. Document Database/Nosql dtabase:
-------------------------   
   
   Data will be stored in seperate documents and each document is independent of
others.

eg: MongoDB 
https://www.trustradius.com/nosql-databases




MongoDB Structure:
===================

MongoDb physical database contains several logical database.
  Each dtabase contains several collections. collection is something like table in
  relational dtabase.
    Each collection contains several documents. Documents is something like record/ row in relatonal dtabase.
	
	eg:
	--
	Database: Shopping card databse 
	collection: customer collection,products, orders
	Customer collection: contain several documents
  
  document1: 
        {
		'name':"sunny",
		"age":40,
		"salary":1000
		
		}
		document2: 
        {
		"name":"sathya"
		}
document3: 
        {
		"name":"bunny",
		"age":30
		"address":{
		            "city":"hyderabad"
		          },
		   "hobbies":[
		   {""name:"cricket"},{"name":swimming}
		   ]
		}


How data represented in MongoDB?
  in json(BSON)format
  json: java script object notation
  BSON: binary json 
  
  
  key charecteristics of MongoDB database:
  ==========================
 0. insrallation and setup is ery easy
 
  1. All information related to a document will be stored in a single place.
To rtrive data, it is not required to perform join operaions and hence
retrival is very fast.

2.Documents are independent of each other and no schema. hence we can
 store unstrutured data like vidoes, audio files etc...
 
3. we can perform operations like editing documents, deleteing document and 
inserting new documents  very easily.

4.Retrival data is in the form of json which can be understandable by any programming language without any conversion,

5. we can store very huge amount of data and hence scalability is more.

Note: performance and flexibilty are biggest assets of this database. 
 
MongoDB-->it is database from mongodb vendor.

mongodb.com





MongoDB Shell vs MongoDB Server:
============================

Once we insatll Mongodb, we will get mongodb shell and mongodb server.

These are javascript beased applications.

MongoDB Server is responsible to store our data in dtabase.
Mongodb Shell is repsonsible for to manage server.

By using this shell we can performm all required CRUD operations

MongoDB  server can be either local or remote.

To Launch/start MongoDB Server --> mongod    command 
To Luunch/start MongoDB Shell   --->mongo    command

MongoDb Drivers:
---------------
From Application(java,python,c# etc) if we want to communicate with database, some special software must be required, which is nothing but driver software.

what is the diff between Oracl DB and Mango DB:
=======================================

MangoDb installation:
==================
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community



C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin>mongod -version
db version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}



==>
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin>mongo -version
MongoDB shell version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}



path setting: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin
   
    set the path
	
	
	
command:   mongod 

{"error":"NonExistentPath: Data directory C:\\data\\db\\ not found. Create the missing directory or specify another path using (1) the --dbpath command line option, or (2) by adding the 'storage.dbPath' option in the configuration file."}}

***
create one folder "data" in c drive
   in data folder create anothe folder name with db 

enter command: mongod    ==>server started 

data stored c:data/db 




open other cmd:   type mongo    it will open shell

search for db.version()     => it will show version of the shell 




to show any logical databases :
 
===> show dbs 
 
 > db.version()
5.0.8
> show dbs
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB


How many dtabases we have:
-----
Default databases:
   mongodb admin will use these defalut dtabases.


1.admin:
=========
admin database is used tp store user authenticationa nd autherization.
information like USERNAMES,PASSWORDS, ROLES AND ETC,...

  THIS DATABASE IS USED BY ADMINISTARTORS WHILE CREATING, DELETEING, updating,users and while assigngn roles.
  
  2. config:
  ========
  To store configuration information of mongodb server 
  
  3. local:
  --------
  
 local dtabase can be used by admin ehile performning Replication.
 
 
 Data Formats In MongoDB:
 -----------------------
 
 json: {name:'sathya'}---> Bson and that Bson will be stored 
 
 Bson: binary json 
 
 1. In JAVASCRIPT ONLY 6 TYPES ARE AVAILABLE
 
   String,Number,Object,Array,Boolean,Null
   
   But Bson provides extra types also like 
     32-bit Integer--->NumberInt
	 ObjectId
	 Date
	 etc
	 
	 
	 
	 2. Bson format requires less memory
	 
	 Json-->10kb
	 Bson-->4 to 5kb
	 
Note: Effecient storage and extra dta types are speciality of Bson over json
